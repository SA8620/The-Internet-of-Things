With the development and popularization of the Internet, every household has the Internet, and the demand for smart homes is increasing. Users can use smart home apps to send commands over the Internet to control the Internet-connected smart homes at home. For example, an app can switch smart light bulbs on and off. Intelligent fan, users can use the app to control the fan's airspeed and automatic power on and off. The sweeping robot allows users to set the robot to clean up the garbage in the home regularly and operate it without having to use it at home, automating all processes.

IoT can help traffic networks command and share real-time traffic conditions. Through the map app, users can view the road surface of traffic in real-time to avoid busy traffic sections. Traffic lights can connect to the Internet through nearby signal towers, report relevant road conditions, and make corresponding judgments, so that traffic can flow, reducing safety risks and saving drivers time in traffic jams. Logistics companies can report the truck's transportation progress to buyers through IoT, and the truck driver and company can also remotely monitor the status of the goods in the car through the network.

<br>
Medical institutions can monitor patientsâ€™ physical health in real-time through the Internet of Things, implant chips in the patient's body, carry identification devices on the body, and regularly monitor the physiological index of the patient. Once an abnormality occurs, it can immediately send a warning to notify the doctor through the network so that the patient can get timely treatment. Teletherapy for remote areas or third-world countries, doctors can conduct remote therapy online, reduce local medical expenses, help reduce close contact, avoid spreading the virus, and ensure medical combat strength. Taking Hong Kong as an example, during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government launched an online Chinese medicine service called remote Chinese medicine. Taking Hong Kong as an example, during the pandemic of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government launched an online Chinese medicine service to provide services remotely through the Internet, and patients could go to nearby medical institutions to collect their medicines after online diagnosis.
