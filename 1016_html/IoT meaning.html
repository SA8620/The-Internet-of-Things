<p>IoT (Internet of Things) is a concept that connects everything to the Internet, including transportation, home devices, and even clothes. This technology uses the internet to transfer data over the internet; it allows them to automate tasks.
<p>IoT systems include sensors, networks, and software, allowing them to collect data from users and the environment. This data automates tasks like recessed lights, fans, etc.   
<p>IoT also provides tons of applications, like healthcare, smart home, smart cities, industrial, and transportation; it is a technology that can affect our daily life in the future. We wonâ€™t have to drive by ourselves when smart cities come out. IoT collects data from the road, sends it to the server, and analyzes the road condition to attain autopilot.
