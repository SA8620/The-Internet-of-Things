# IoT Educational Website

A static website project for the **SEHH1016 Introduction to Internet Technology** course, exploring the fundamentals, advantages, disadvantages, and real-world applications of the Internet of Things (IoT).

## Features

- **Homepage**: Central navigation to all sections.
- **IoT Overview**: Explanation of IoT, its components, and applications.
- **Advantages & Disadvantages**: Detailed lists of IoT pros and cons (note: disadvantages page is a placeholder).
- **Real-World Examples**: Smart home, transportation, and medical use cases with images.
- **Feedback Form**: Submit comments via email (requires mailto client setup).
- **Consistent Styling**: Background images, yellow text on grooved tables, and navigation links.

## Notes

- The feedback form uses `mailto:` – functionality depends on the user's local email client configuration.
- The "Disadvantages" page (`IoT -ve.html`) contains placeholder text (Xs) and needs completion.
- Some image filenames include spaces (e.g., `Transportation system.jpg`). Ensure paths are correctly referenced.

## Potential Improvements

- Add CSS for modern styling (current design uses inline HTML attributes).
- Replace placeholder content in `IoT -ve.html`.
- Implement server-side processing for the feedback form (e.g., PHP/Node.js).
- Fix broken links (e.g., `Reference.html` not provided).
